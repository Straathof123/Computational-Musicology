# Computational-Musicology

For this exercise I haven't been able to work in the corpus I originally chose. That is because I couldn't get it to work where I could get data from albums, but I was able to get data from playlist. So I chose a playlist I listen to frequently, called: Pokemon Lofi Beats. 
The original description of the assignment is listed down below.

My musical corpus will be the Djesse albums 1 to 3 by Jacob Collier. There is a fourth Djesse album on its way and will be released at the end of february, but I think it’s easier to analyze if I can start right away, seeing as we're still in the middle of february. I might change this if it becomes clear that I’ll only be working with my corpus after a couple weeks. 

I really like Jacob Collier’s music and am a big fan. His Djesse albums especially blow me out of the water each time. His music is so different from anyone else’s. He has his very distinct style which is instantly recognizable. Jacob Collier is his own genre within music in a way. 

The comparison points will probably be the songs which aren’t on the Djesse albums. I might find it interesting to discover if there is a difference between the Djesse albums and other songs. I’m expecting that there will be a constant theme within the Djesse albums, which wouldn’t be the case with independent songs and the ‘In My Room’ album. 

The thing that I think is going to be the most troubling, is the fact that there are not that many songs, probably around 50 songs. This will be an issue if I would be able to succeed in my research if there were more songs. For example, if I’m seeing a correlation, but that correlation is dependent on 2 or 3 songs being the same in a way, that isn’t much evidence. With more songs, this evidence would be stronger. 

I think the biggest outlier song will be ‘Moon River’ on Djesse vol. 2. This song is completely sung acapella and is very different from everything else, even though everything Jacob Collier makes is varying in every aspect.
